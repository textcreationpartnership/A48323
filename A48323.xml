            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Treatise of <hi>Dialling</hi> here recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto thee, consisteth of three <hi>Parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>first Part</hi> is <hi>Geometrical,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth the whole <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Dialling</hi> by <hi>Scale</hi> and <hi>Compasses;</hi> by <hi>Projecting</hi> of the <hi>Sphere</hi> in <hi>Plano</hi> upon the <hi>Dial Plain</hi> it self, i. e. By drawing upon the <hi>Plain</hi> such <hi>Circles</hi> of the <hi>Sphere</hi> in their true position, as any way relate to the delineating of the <hi>Hour-lines</hi> upon such a <hi>Plain,</hi> let the <hi>Plain</hi> be in any position, and the <hi>Place</hi> in any situation, in respect of Latitude; by which manner of delineation, the <hi>hour-lines</hi> being drawn, shall naturally fall in their due places upon the <hi>Plain,</hi> having no other consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, than only knowing how the <hi>Circles</hi> of the <hi>Sphere</hi> are posited upon the <hi>Globe</hi> it self; which will be sufficient to carry you through the whole <hi>Work.</hi> And to that end (after some few necessary <hi>Geometrical Problems</hi>) at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb facs="tcp:59915:5"/>of the Book, I have some <hi>Astronomical Elements</hi> giving the <hi>Reader</hi> a breif account of those <hi>Circles,</hi> and also of their situation up o the <hi>Globe:</hi> And in the <hi>Conclusion</hi> of this <hi>first Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>second Part</hi> is <hi>Arithmetial,</hi> shewing how by <hi>Arithmetical Calculation</hi> (by help of the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> of Artificial <hi>Sines</hi> and <hi>Tangents</hi>) to find the situation of any <hi>Plain,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Calculate</hi> the true places of the <hi>Stile, Substile,</hi> and <hi>Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

(I.) For the saving my self the <hi>labour</hi> of <hi>Calculating</hi> of so many New ones. And (II.) but chiefly, for the <hi>Practitioners</hi> satisfaction, that he may see what <hi>harmony</hi> there is, between <hi>Arithmetical
<pb facs="tcp:59915:5"/>Calculation,</hi> and <hi>Geometrical Projection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>third Part</hi> is <hi>Instrumental,</hi> and teacheth how to delineate hour lines upon all sorts of <hi>Plains,</hi> by help of a <hi>Plain, Cheap,</hi> and <hi>Portable Instrument,</hi> which I call <hi>A HOROLOGICAL TRIGON,</hi> by which the <hi>Stile, Substile,</hi> and <hi>Hour-lines,</hi> upon any <hi>Plain,</hi> may easily and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily be <hi>Protracted,</hi> having very few lines to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>It may now be expected that I should shew how to <hi>beautify</hi> or <hi>adorn</hi> those <hi>Dials,</hi> by inscrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them other <hi>Spherical</hi> Circles and Lines (besides the common hours) as the <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial</hi> and <hi>Tropicks,</hi> the <hi>Parallels</hi> of <hi>Declination, Parallels</hi> of the <hi>Suns Place,</hi> of the <hi>Length</hi> of the <hi>Day,</hi> of the <hi>Suns <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Plains,</hi> I was the more willing to omit them in this place, at this time; my other occasions not giving me so much leasure, as to prosecute those things answerable to my own <hi>desire,</hi> or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious <hi>Practioners satisfaction.</hi> But this I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise (God willing) that in due time (as I find this accepted) I will publish something else of <hi>Dialling,</hi> and that not only of the making of <hi>Dials</hi> upon <hi>Plains,</hi> but upon <hi>irregular Superficies</hi> also, as upon <hi>Cylinders, Cones,</hi> and <hi>Spheres,</hi> both <hi>Concave</hi> and <hi>Convex,</hi> and also upon irregular <hi>Concave</hi> or <hi>Convex Superficies,</hi> and that both by <hi>Reflexion</hi> and <hi>Refraxion,</hi> with divers other things of the like nature: In the mean time take this in good part, from him who is ready to serve thee in his Employment.</p>

               <div type="definition">
                  <head>DEFINITION.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Line of Chords</hi> is no other than 60 degrees of the Arch of any Circle, transferred from the limb of a Circle to a streight line; Now every Circle, great or small, is divided (or supposed so to be) into 360 equal parts called

                  <p>First, draw a Right line of any length, as C B D, and upon the middle thereof (by the first, or fourth, Plobleme) erect the Perpendicular A B.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Open your Compasses to the Radius or length that you would have your line of Chords to be of, which suppose A B, <hi>(which I make here equal to the line of Chords that most of the Schemes and Diagrams in this Book were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by)</hi> and with that distance upon B, as a centre, describe the Semicircle C A D, which is divided into two equal parts, or Quadrants, by the perpendicular line A B.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Divide the Arch, or Quadrant, A R D, into 90 equal parts or degrees, which you may do in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner [Take the length of the line A B, and set it that distance upon the Quadrant A D, from D to R, so is D R 60 deg. and A R 30 deg. Then take the distance A R, and set it from D to S, so is the Quadrant divided into 3 equal parts, at the points S and R. each containing 30 deg. This done, divide the several spaces between A R. R S. and S D, into 3 equal parts, each of which will be 10 deg. according as you see the numbers set to them, these must be again divided into two equal parts, containing 5 degrees,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59915:14"/>and every of those into 5 smaller as you see in the figure, and so will the whole Quadrant be divided into 90.]</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Quadrant A R S D being thus divided into 90 parts or degrees, set one foot of your Compasses in D, and open the other foot to A, and describe the Arch A E F, touching the line C D in F, so is the point F. upon the right line C D, the Chord of 90 deg.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Open the Compasses from D, to 80 deg. and describe the arch 80 G H. So shall the point H. be the Chord of 80 deg.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Open the Compasses from D to 70, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the arch 70 J K, So is K the Chord of 70 deg.</p>
                  <p>Again, Open the Compasses from D to R, the Radius, or 60 deg. and describe the arch R L B, so is B the Chord of 60 deg. equal to the Radius.</p>

                     <p>The two Tropicks are smaller Circles of the Sphere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed parallel to the Aequinoctial Circle, and at 23 deg. and a half distant therefrom, that being the greatest decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that the Sun hath from the Aequinoctial towards either of the Poles.

                  </div>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Hour Circles, <hi>and</hi> Azimuths.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>HOur Circles</hi> are great Circles of the Sphere, which meet together in the Poles of the World, and cross the Aequinoctial at Right Angles; of which, the Meridian (or outward Circle in this figure) is the hour Circle of 12, the streight line P Q S, which represents the Axes of the World, is also the Hour-circle of Six, and all the rest of the hour circles are drawn from Pole to Pole between them, as the Circle P A S, represents the hour circle of 8 and 4 a clock, and so of all the rest, which are 12 in Number, representing the 24 hours of the day and night being taken round the Globe or Sphere.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Azimuths</hi> are also Great Circles of the Sphere, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together in the <hi>Zenith</hi> and <hi>Nadir</hi> points, and fall upon, or intersect, the Horizon, at right angles; as the Hour-circles do the Aequinoctial. Of these Circles, the outermost Circle of this figure, represents the North and South Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth; and the line Z Q N the Azimuth of East and West; and is commonly called the <hi>Prime-Vertical Circle.</hi> And all
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59915:17"/>other Circles drawn through the Zenith and Nadir points, and cutting the Horizon at right Angles, are intermediate Azimuths, between the East and West, and the North or South points. As in the Figure, the circle Z B N is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate Azimuth between the South and the West, it being 40 deg. distant from O the South point.</p>
                     <p>Every Circle of the Sphere hath its proper Poles, which are alwayes 90 deg. distant from it in all parts.</p>
                     <p>So in the former Figure Z the Zenith, and N the Nadir points, are the Poles of the Horizon, they being 90 deg. distant from O the South point, from Q the West point, and from H the North point of the Horizon.</p>
                     <p>Also Q is the Pole of the Meridian Circle H Z O N, it being 90 deg. distant therefrom in all parts.</p>
                     <p>Again P and S, the North and South Poles of the World, are also the Poles of the Aequinoctial Circle, they being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved therefrom on either side 90 deg.</p>
                     <p>But the Pole of the Hour-circle P A S is at <hi>C,</hi> and the Pole of the Azimuth Circle Z B N is at D, and how to finde these Poles, and also the Poles of any oblique Circles, shall be discovered in divers places of the following dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, where there is often occasion for the finding of them.</p>
                     <p>Note, <hi>And whereas throughout this Book there is continual mention made of Degrees and Minutes, know, that a Degree is the <hi>360</hi> part of any Circle, each of which degrees is supposed to be divided into <hi>60</hi> parts called Minutes, so that <hi>45</hi> min. is three quarters of a degree, <hi>30</hi> min. half a degree, and <hi>15</hi> min. one quarter of a degree,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>These are such <hi>Astronomical Elements,</hi> as I conceive, most necessary for the understanding of that which follows,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59915:18"/>it resteth now that I shew how to perform two or three <hi>Astronomical Conclusions,</hi> Geometrically, without which the knolwedge of making of a Dyall will be of little validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; For to what purpose will a Diall serve, without it be rightly placed? Or, how can you make a Diall for any appointed place, without you first know the position or situation thereof? and to these purposes are the following Conclusions subservient.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And because it is requisite to know at all times of the year, what declination the Sun hath from the Aequinoctial either Northward or Southward, I have therefore at the end of this Introduction, inserted two Tables, the one shewing the Suns declination every day in the year.

And, because the Aequinoctial Circle is, in all parts, distant from the Poles of the World, 90 deg. take 90 deg. of your Chord, and set them from P to AE, and from S to ae, and draw the line AE Q ae, for the Aequinoctial Circle.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, The Suns Altitude given being 45 deg. Take 45 deg. from your Chord, and set them from H to A, and from O to T; then lay a Ruler, either from H to T, or from O to A, and the Ruler will cross the Prime vertical Circle in L, through which point the Circle of the Suns Altitude must be drawn, and for the drawing of it, you have three points, A, L and T. wherefore by the 6<seg rend="sup">th</seg> Probleme beforegoing you may finde its centre, which will alwayes be in the Prime Vertical Circle Z Q N, extended.</item>
                  <item>Fourthly, The Suns declination for the day proposed, (<hi>viz.</hi> the 11<seg rend="sup">th</seg> of <hi>May</hi>) being 20 deg. 20 min.

                     <hi>II.</hi> For the Declination.</head>
                  <p>The declination of a Plain is an arch of the Horizon comprehended between the Pole of the Plain, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian of the Place, or it is the distance of the Plain it self, from the prime Vertical Circle, or Azimuth of East and West.</p>
                  <p>To find out the declination of any plain, there are required two observations, the first of the Horizontal distance of the Sun from the Pole of the Plain, and Secondly of the Suns altitude taken at the same moment of time.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. To find the Suns Horizontal distance from the Pole of the Plain, apply one edge of a Quadrant to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal line of your plain, so that the other may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular to it, and the Limb of the Quadrant may be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sun, and hold the whole Quadrant Horizontal (as near as you can conjecture). Then holding up a thread and plummet at full liberty, so that the shadow of the thread may passe both through the Centre and Limb of the Quadrant, observe then the degrees cut by the shadow of the thread, and number them from that side of the Quadrant that standeth square or perpendicular to the Plain, For those degrees are the Horizontal distance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</item>
                     <item>2. This Horizontal distance and the Suns altitude being
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59915:24"/>observed at the same time will help you to the Plains decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by the rules following.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>First, by having the altitude you may find the Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth by the two last Problems of the Introduction, Then by comparing the Azimuth, and this distance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, you may find the plains declination in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>When you make your observations of the Suns Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal distance, mark whether the shadow of the thread fall between the South, and that side of the Quadrant which is perpendicular to the plain.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. If the shadow fall between them, the Azimuth and distance added together do make the declination of the plain, and in this case the declination is upon the same coast whereon the Suns Azimuth is.</item>
                     <item>2. If the shadow fall not between them, then the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the distance and Azimuth is the Plains de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and if the Azimuth be the greater of the two, then the Plain declines to the same Coast whereon the Sun is, but if the distance be the greater, then the Plain declines to the contrary coast.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>And here note, that the declination thus found is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes accounted from the South, and that all declinations are counted from either South or North, towards either East or West, and must never exceed 90. degrees.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. If therefore the degrees of declination do exceed 90. you must take the residue of that number to 180. and that shall be the Plains declination from the North.</item>
                     <item>2. If the degrees of declination exceed 180. degrees then the excesse above 180. degr. gives the Plains decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from the North, towards that Coast, which is contrary to the coast whereon the Sun is.</item>

                  <p>First, Draw a Circle F, S, W, N, which circle let re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present your vertical Plain, crosse it in the middle thereof at right angles with the two diameters, <hi>viz.</hi> S, Q, N, for the Meridian, and hour-line of 12, and E, Q, W, for the Prime Vertical or hour-line of 6.</p>

Draw the line AE, W, which divide in two equal parts in the point A, upon which point A raise the perpendicular A, C, cutting the Meridian S, N, in the point G, which is the centre of the Aequinoctial Circle E, AE, W, upon which point, and the distance <hi>c</hi> AE, you may describe it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Divide the Semicircle E, N, W, into 12 e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual parts at the points â â â, &amp;c. beginning at the point N, and setting six on either side thereof.

                  <p>Fifthly, Lay a Ruler to Q, the centre of the Plain, and upon every of these points â â â, and the Ruler will cut the Aequinoctial E, AE, W, in the points * * *, &amp;c. divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that into 12 unequal parts.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, A Ruler laid to P, the Pole of the World, and the several points * * * &amp;c. upon the Aequinoctial, will cut the Circle representing the plain in the points | | |, &amp;c, Semicircle E, N, W, into 12 other unequal parts.</p>

               <p>THose Plains are said to be Erect or Upright, which stand perpendicular to the Horizon of the Place, whose Vertex or upper part tendeth to the Zenith, and their lower part to the Nadir, and such are the walls of Steeples, Churches, Houses, or the like, against which Dials are made.</p>
               <p>Of these Upright or Erect lines, there are two sorts, <hi>viz.</hi> Direct, and Declining.</p>
               <p>Those Erect or Upright Plains are said to be Direct, which do directly behold either the true East, West, North, or South points of the Horizon, or whose Poles do lie directly in either of them, and these Plains are called <hi>Erect direct</hi> Plains.</p>
               <p>Those Erect or Upright Plains are said to decline, which do not lie in, nor directly behold any of these points, but are scituate under some other Azimuth, as South East, North-West, North-East, &amp;c. and these Plains are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Erect or <hi>Upright declining</hi> Plains.

               <p>THat Plain is called, by me, a direct South Plain, which lieth in the prime Vertical Circle, or East and West Azimuth, and whose Pole is in the South Part of the Meridian, the making whereof differeth nothing from that going before. Only for the height of the stile, instead of the Latitude you must take the complement thereof.</p>

                  <p>First, Draw a Circle Z, E, W, N, Representing an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Direct South Plain, Crosse it at right Angles with the diameters Z Q N for the Meridian, or hour-line of 12, and W Q E for the prime vertical Circle, or hour-line of six.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Out of your line of chords take 38. deg. 28. min. (which is the complement of the Latitude of the place) and set that distance upon the Dial plain, from Z to <hi>a,</hi> and from E to <hi>b,</hi> and from N to E.</p>

                  <p>Fifthly, Lay a Ruler to Q, and each of these points â â â, and the Ruler will cross the Aequinoctial circle in the points * * *, &amp;c. dividing that into 12 unequal parts.</p>

                  <p>Lastly, If through the centre Q, and the respective points | | |, &amp;c. you draw right lines, they shall be true hour lines of an Erect, Direct, South Plain.</p>

               <p>I Call that an East or West Plain, which lies in the Meridian of the place; and whose Poles lie in the prime vertical circle, or Azimuth of East or West.</p>
               <p>Now forasmuch, as the Plain lieth in the very Meridian Circle, in which also the two Poles of the World are seated, the Plain must necessarily passe through both these Poles, and so neither of them can have any elevation above it; wherefore the hour-lines in these Dials must be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to one another, and consequently parallel to the axis of the World. And the Dial must have no centre, however, the Dial may be drawn, as followeth.</p>

Then, that you may proportion your stile to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59915:29"/>your plain, so that you may bring on all the hours from Sun rising to 11 a clock, assume two points in the line F D, one towards the end D (as the point G) for the hour-line of 11, and another at H, for the hour-line of 6, and through the points G and H, draw the lines 11 G 11,

                  <p>Now for the drawing of the hour-lines set one foot of the Compasses (opened to 60 deg. of the chord) in L, and with the other describe the arch of a circle M N, betwixt the hour-line of 6, and the line G L. Which divide into 5 equal parts in the points â â â â â, and a Ruler laid from the point L, to each of these points â â â, &amp;c. will cut the Aequinoctial line H D in the points * * * * *, through which points draw lines parallel to 6 H 6, as the lines 7 * 7, 8 * 8, &amp;c. and they shall be the true hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of an East Plain, from 6 in the morning till 11 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noon, but for the hours of 4 and 5 in the morning you may put them on by setting the same distances upon the Aequinoctial line before 6, as there is from 6 to 7 and 8 after 6, and through those points draw the hour-lines of 4 and 5 parallel to the hour of 6, as you see done in the figure.</p>
                  <p>Thus is your Dial finished, and in the making of it you have made two Dials, namely a West Dial as well as an East, for it is the same in all respects. Only whereas the Arch E F, through which the Equinoctial passeth in the East Dial was drawn on the right hand of the Plain, In the West it must be drawn on the left hand, and the hour lines of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, in the forenoon on the East Dial must be 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, upon the West Dial, as in the figure appeareth.</p>

                  <p>Thus have you finished your Dial, and in the making of this, you have made a South Declining West 80 degrees also; for if you turn the Paper, and look through it, it will on the back-side be a South Declining West 80 deg. only the forenoon hours in this, must be the afternoon hours in that: Nay, in rigour, you have in this one Dial made four, <hi>viz.</hi> a North declining either East or West, if you well observe what was said and done in the last <hi>Chapter.</hi>

                  <p>And thus have I done with all Upright, or Erect Plains, either Direct or Declining. I shall now proceed to shew you how to inscribe Hour-lines upon such Plains as are not Upright, but Recline from the Zenith, and of them there are such as are Direct, and such as do Decline.</p>

                     <item>1. The South Plain may Recline, so as it may just fall in the Axis of the World, and so pass through the Poles of the World, and then is it called an Equinoctial Plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Poles thereof lye in the Equinoctial Circle, and neither of the Poles have any elevation above it, wherefore the hour-lines must be all Parallel one to the other, and all of them to the Axis of the World, and the Dial must be drawn as the Erect direct East or West Dials were. Only whereas the Stile stood upon the hour-line of 6 in the East and West, in these Plains it must stand upon the hour-line of 12, and be of equal height, with the distance between the hours of 13 and 9, or 12 and 3, which are equidistant from the Meridian.</item>
                     <item>2. Or <hi>Secondly,</hi> the South Plain may so recline, that it may fall between the Zenith and the North Pole, and then is the South Pole elevated above such Plains. Or,</item>

               <head>CHAP. <hi>XII.</hi> How to draw the hour-lines upon a direct South Reclining Plain, which falls between the Zenith and the Pole.</head>
               <p>Let the Example be of a South Plain, Reclining 25 deg. in the Latitude of <hi>London</hi> 51 deg. 32 min.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIrst,</hi> Draw the Circle W, N, E, R, representing your Reclining Plain. Cross it with the two Diameters N, R, for the Meridian and hour-line of 12, and W, E, for the Horizontal line of the Plain, and hour-line of six.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Take 25 deg. the Plains Reclination, out of your line of Chords, and set that distance from N to <hi>a,</hi> and from E to <hi>b.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A Ruler laid from W to <hi>a,</hi> will give Z the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith of the place; and a Ruler laid from W to <hi>b,</hi> will give S the South point of the Horizon; both which Circles W, Z, E, the Prime Vertical, and W, R, E, the Horizon, may be drawn, as hath often enough already been shewn, their Centres being always in the Meridian line N, Q, R, extended if need require.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Because the Pole of the World is always di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the Zenith, the Complement of the Latitude of the place, <hi>viz.</hi> here at <hi>London,</hi> 38 deg. 28. min. Take (therefore) 38 deg. 28 min. out of your line of Chords, and set them upon your Plain from <hi>a,</hi> the point which found the Zenith to <hi>c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:59915:43"/>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Lay a Ruler from W to <hi>c,</hi> and it will cut the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian N, Q, R, (being extended) in P, so is P the North Pole of the World, and because it falleth without the Plain, it is evident by the Scheme, that this Reclining Plain, passeth through the Meridian, between the Zenith and the Pole. And again, because the North Pole P, falleth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Plain, it also demonstrates that the South Pole must be elevated above this Plain. Wherefore,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> To find the point of the South Pole upon the Meridian line N, Q, R, do thus. Because the two Poles are 180 deg. distant from each other, <hi>viz.</hi> two Quadrants, or
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59915:43"/>twice 90 deg. Take therefore 90 deg. out of your line of Chords, and set them twice upon your Plain from <hi>c, viz.</hi> first from <hi>c</hi> to <hi>e,</hi> and then from <hi>e</hi> to <hi>n,</hi> so shall the 180 deg. end in <hi>n.</hi> And a Ruler being laid from W to <hi>n,</hi> shall cross the Meridian in A, the South Pole; so is the South Pole A, Elevated above the Reclining Plain, the quantity of A R, which is equal to the Arch R <hi>n,</hi> which measured upon the line of Chords will be found 13 deg. 28 min.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Lay a Ruler from W to <hi>e,</hi> and it will cut the Meridian in AE, so is AE that point in the Meridian through which the Equinoctial must pass. As also through the points E and W, the East and West points of the Horizon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> For the Hour-lines, They are to be drawn in all respects as the Hour-lines were upon the Upright South Plain, without any alteration, only there the Stile was ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated according to the Complement of the Latitude, 38 deg. 28 min. here it must be elevated only 13 deg. 28 min. as in the Scheme. The manner how the hour-lines are to be put on, I shall only repeat, but I shall forbear drawing them, leaving that to your own practice, in regard there is no alteration at all from the Erect Direct South Plain. Wherefor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap> divide the Semicircle of your Plain W, R, E, into 12 equal parts, (beginning at R, and so 6 equal parts on either side of the Meridian N, Q, R.) Then lay a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to Q, and every of those 12 divisions, it will divide the Equinoctial into 12 unequal parts. A Ruler laid from P to every of those unequal parts in the Equinoctial, will divide the Plain into 12 unequal parts, through which last 12 unequal parts, and the Centre Q, if you draw right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, they shall be the true Hour-lines proper for the Plain.</p>
               <p>And here by the way note, for that the Equinoctial Circle in this Scheme is a very oblique Arch, the Centre of it will be very remote, and the hour-spaces upon it (as also upon
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59915:44"/>the Plain) will be very close together in these small draughts, which is occasioned by the small Elevation that the South Pole hath above this Plain, <hi>viz.</hi> but 13 deg. 28 min. which you might find without drawing of the Scheme by Substracting 25 deg. the Plains Reclination, represented in the Scheme by the line (or circle) N, Z, from Z, P, the Complement of the Latitude of the place. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, foreseeing that the Pole hath but small Elevation above the Plain, and also what Pole, whether North or South that is Elevated. The better way will be to augment the Stile, and to draw the Dial according to these following dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>

                  <head>How to draw the Hour-lines upon the Plain.</head>
                  <p>In the Scheme following, draw <hi>First,</hi> The right line W, Q, E, for the Horizontal, and Perpendicular thereunto, the line S, Q, R, for the Meridian and Hour-line of 12. which extend above the Horizontal-line, as to S.</p>
                  <p>

               <p>Example of a North Plain, Reclining 51 deg. 32 min. equal to the Latitude of the Place, <hi>viz.</hi> London.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Set 51 deg. 32 min. the Reclination of the Plain, (which in this Example is also equal to the Latitude of the place) from AE to <hi>a,</hi> and also from E to <hi>b.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> To draw the hours upon this Plain it is easiest of all others, for if you divide the Semicircle E, R, W, into 12 equal parts in the points â â â, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and through those Points draw straight lines from the Centre Q, they shall be the true Hour lines belonging to this Polar Plain.</p>
               <p>And this Plain, by reason of its North Reclination, is, in
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59915:47"/>Summer, capable of receiving all the hours from Sun rising to Sun-setting, and therefore the hour-lines of 4 and 5 in the morning, and of 7 and 8 at night must be drawn through the Centre, as you did in the Vertical or Horizontal Dial, and as you see here done in this Figure.</p>
               <p>The Stile of this Dial must be a streight Pin or Wyre, set perpendicular upon the Plain, from the Centre Q, and of any length. And this for the First Variety of North Recliners.</p>

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Because the Equinoctial is always 90 deg. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from either of the Poles, set 90 deg. upon your Plain, from <hi>c</hi> to <hi>d.</hi> Then laying a Ruler to E and <hi>d,</hi> it will cut the Meridian in Ae, so is Ae the point of the intersection of the Equinoctial, with the North part of the Meridian; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore through the points E, Ae, W, describe the Equinoctial Circle; the Centre whereof, as also of the Horizon, and Prime Vertical Circle, will fall in the Meridian S, Q, R, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended where need requires.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Horizon, Equinoctial, and Pole, being thus seated in their true positions, upon the Plain; the thing required in this Dial is, <hi>The height of the Pole above the Plain,</hi> which may be found in this manner. â Lay a Ruler from E to P, and it will cut the Plain in <hi>c,</hi> the distance S, <hi>c,</hi> measured upon your line of Chords, will contain 63 deg. 28 min. which is the height of the Pole above the Reclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Plain.</p>

                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> For the drawing of the Hours, that is done the same way as in the Erect Direct South Plain, only here the Stile must be elevated above the Meridian-line 63 deg. 28 min. whereas there it was only 38 deg. 28 min. the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of the Latitude. The North Pole is elevated above this Plain, and the hours that the Plain is capable to receive, are 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. in the morning, and 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, at night.</p>

                  </gap> deg. 32 min.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIrst,</hi> Draw the Circle E, S, W, R, representing your North Reclining Plain, and cross it with the two Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters S, Q, R, for the Meridian of the Place, and with E, Q, W, the Horizontal line of the Plain.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:59915:49"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Set the Reclination of the Plain 70 deg. from S to <hi>a,</hi> and from W to <hi>b.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Lay a Ruler to E and <hi>a,</hi> it will cut the Meridian in Z the Zenith, through which and the points E and W, draw the Prime Vertical Circle E, Z, W.â Also, lay a Ruler from E to <hi>b,</hi> it will cut the Meridian in N, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersection of the Meridian with the North part of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, and through this point, and E and W, describe the Horizon of the Place, E, N, W.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Forasmuch as the Pole is distant from the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith of the Place 38 deg. 28 min, (equal to the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Latitude) set 38 deg. 28 min. from <hi>a,</hi> the point which gave the Pole P to <hi>c,</hi> and lay a Ruler from E to <hi>c,</hi> so shall it cross the Meridian in P, the Pole of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Because the Equinoctial is in all places situate 90 deg. from either Pole. Take 90 deg. in your Compasses, and set them off from <hi>c,</hi> (the point which gave the Pole P,) both ways, to <hi>e</hi> above, and to <hi>g</hi> below. So a Ruler laid from E to <hi>g,</hi> will cut the Meridian (it being extended) in Ae, without the Plain, which shews that the North part of the Equinoctial Circle lies below this Plain. Therefore, lay a Ruler from E to <hi>e,</hi> and it will cross the Meridian in Ae above, within the Plain. So is Ae the point where the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, and the South point of the Equinoctial will intersect, and through that point, and the points E and W, must the Equinoctial E, Ae, W, be drawn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Horizon, Pole, and Equinoctial, being thus projected the thing required in this Plain is, <hi>The height of the Pole above it, viz.</hi> P, R, which may be found in this manner. â Lay a Ruler from E to P, and it will cut the Plain in <hi>c,</hi> the distance from R to <hi>c,</hi> measure upon the Chord, will be 71 deg. 32 min. which is the height of the Pole above this Reclining Plain.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:59915:49"/>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> For the drawing of the Hour-lines, they are done in all respects as those before in South Erect Plains, only in this make the Elevation of the Stile 71 deg. 32 min. as you find it by your projection.</p>
               <p>Your Hour-lines being drawn, erect the Stile 71 deg. 32 min. above the Meridian or Substile, letting it point up to the North Pole, because that Pole above this Plain is so much elevated, and being this Plain is but 20 deg. raised above the Horizon, <hi>viz.</hi> the complement of its Reclination, the Plain is capable to receive all the hours from 4 in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to 8 at night, and therefore the hours of 4 and 5 in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59915:50"/>the morning, and 7 and 8 in the evening, must be drawn through the Centre, as was done in the Vertical or Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal Dial.</p>
               <p>And thus have you had Examples of all the Varieties, both of East, West, North, and South Reclining Plains; and no other can possibly fall out in any place whatsoever. The Inclining Plains, are the same with the Recliners opposite to them; and must be drawn in the same manner, as hath been (in some measure) heretofore hinted, and shall be more at large discoursed of hereafter, when I have done with <hi>Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Reclining Plains,</hi> of which I come now to treat.</p>

                  <hi>Let the Example be of a South Plain Declining East,</hi> 30 <hi>deg. and Reclining</hi> 34 <hi>deg.</hi> 32. <hi>min. in the Latitude of</hi> London, 51 <hi>deg.</hi> 32 <hi>min.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Draw the Circle H, A, O, R, and cross it with the two Diameters H, O, the Horizontal-line of the Plain, and A, Q, R, the perpendicular-line of the Plain, crossing each other at right-angles, in Q the Centre of the Plain.</p>

               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because the Plain Reclined 34 deg. 34 min. Take 34 deg. 34 min. from your line of Chords, and set them upon your Plain from A to <hi>a,</hi> from H to <hi>b,</hi> and from R to <hi>c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Lay a Ruler from O to <hi>a,</hi> and it will cut the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular line of the Plain in Z, the Zenith of the place Also a Ruler laid from O to <hi>b,</hi> will cut the Plains perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in K, the interlection of the Horizon of the place, with the Plains perpendicular.

               <p>Divide the space between <hi>Z</hi> and N, in two equal parts in C, and through C draw the line C D parallel to Q O, extending it, as you shall have occasion. Also from Q through E draw another right line, Q E ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it, as occasion shall offer; the point of those two lines intersection, is the centre of the Meridian. Which being drawn</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Lay a Ruler from E the East point of the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, to Z the Zenith, and it will cut the Plain in <hi>h.</hi> And, because the Pole of the World is distant from the Zenith 38 deg. 28 min. equal to the Complement of the latitude, set 38 deg. 28 min. from <hi>h</hi> upon the Plain and it will fall just upon P. which is the point of the Plains intersection with the Meridian, which demonstrates the Pole to have no Elevation above the Plain, and so the Plain to be <hi>Equinoctial declining.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Draw the line P Q L for the Axis of the World, and, because the Equinoctial Circle is, in all parts, distant from either Pole 90 deg. set 90 deg. from P, or L,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59915:52"/>to AE; and through Q draw the line AE Q ae for the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial Circle, which is here a straight line, and being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, would pass through the Centre of the Meridian, and also through the East and West points of the Horizon, as it ought to do.</p>
               <p>The Scheme being thus projected, the four requisites from it are easily obtained, For
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>To find the distance of the Meridian, and the Horizon</hi> O P. The Arch O P measured upon your line of Chords will contain 71 deg. 53 min. the distance required.</item>

                  <hi>First,</hi> Describe the Circle H A O R, representing your Reclining Declining Plain, and cross it at right Angles, with the two Diameters A R, for the Perpendicular, and H O, for the Horizontal-line of the Plain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Take 20 deg. the Plains Reclination, out of your Chord, and set them from A to <hi>a,</hi> from O to <hi>b,</hi> and from R to <hi>c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A Ruler laid from H to <hi>a,</hi> will give you Z, the Zenith, and laid from H to <hi>b,</hi> will give you K, the interse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Horizon, with the Perpendicular-line of the Plain.

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Take 30 deg. the Plains Declination, out of your line of Chords, and set them from R to <hi>d</hi> Westward, (because the Plain Declines Eastward) and also from O to <hi>e</hi> so a Ruler being laid from Z to <hi>e,</hi> shall cut the Horizon in E, the East point thereof, and laid from Z to <hi>d,</hi> shall cut the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon in S, the South Point thereof.

               <p>Thus are the four Requisites belonging to this Plain found, and in this Example two things are very observable.</p>

                  <item>2. In respect that the line or arch L <hi>c,</hi> which is the height of the Stile or Pole above the Plain, is but of small
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59915:55"/>Quantity, <hi>viz.</hi> 13 deg. 40. min. it will from thence follow, that the Equinoctials Centre will be very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, and that the hour-lines near to the Substile will be very close, so that in small Dials their distances one from another will be insensible; and therefore you may save the labour of describing the Equinoctial Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and be satisfied in finding of the point B, by which the Plains difference of Longitude is found â For, in such cases as this, the Plains difference of Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the distance of the Meridian from the Horizon, and of the Substiles distance from the Meridian, and the height of the Pole above the Plain being gained; you may proceed to draw the Dial as followeth, not much differing from the drawing of the Upright far Declining Dial <hi>Chapter.</hi>

               <p>But in this Example, the elevation of the Pole or Stile above the Plain, being but of an indifferent quantity, <hi>viz.</hi> 19 deg. 25 min. you may (if you please) draw the hour-lines by one Tangent-line, and the Centre, as was shewed in the second Variety of Direct South Reclining Plains; and as here followeth.</p>

                  <head>How to draw the hour-lines upon the Plain.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Upon your Plain, towards the bottom thereof (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the North Pole is here elevated) draw a Right-line A B, parallel to the Horizon, and assume A for the Centre of your Dial, upon which point, with 60 deg. of your Chord, describe an Arch of a Circle B E, upon which from B, set the distance of the Meridian and Horizon, 64 deg. 41 min.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59915:60"/>to C, and draw the line A C for the hour-line of 12. Also, upon the same Arch, from C to D, set 6 deg. 2 min. the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Substile from the Meridian; and draw the line A D for the Substilar. Again, upon the same Arch, set off 19 deg. 25 min. the height of the Stile, from D to E, and draw the line D E for the Axis of the Stile.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Upon any part of the Substilar-line, assume any point at pleasure. As F, through which draw the right-line G F H perpendicular to the Substile.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> From the point F, take the greatest distance to the Axis of the Stile, and set that distance upon the Substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar-line from F to â, and upon the point â, with 60 deg. of your Chord, describe the Semicircle M L N.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Lay a Ruler from â to K (the point where the Tangent (or Equinoctial-line) crosseth the Meridian) and the Ruler will cut the Semicircle in L, at which point begin to divide it into 12 equal parts in the points â â â, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> If from the Centre A, through these points x x x, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you draw right-lines, they shall be the proper hour-lines belonging to your Plain.</p>
                  <p>For the Stile, it may be either of Plate or Wyre, elevated above the Substile, to an Angle of 19 deg. 25 min. and set up perpendicularly upon the Substilar, as in all other Dials.

               <p>

               <p>This being the third and last Variety of Declining Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Plains, I shall be somewhat the larger in the proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thereof, than I have been in any of the foregoing; not but that this Dial is to be made in all respect like (and with the same case) as the former. But herein I shall shew at large the manner of projection, and how all the Centres are Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically found, and the reasons of their being in such and such lines, and at such and such distances. And also, I shall project all the hour-lines belonging to the Plain upon the Plain it self by circular lines, by which means the Reader may attain to a more competent knowledge in what hath been heretofore in this Treatise delivered. For from this Projection following, all the aforesaid hath been deduced. And therefore I shall describe the manner of the declining of this Dial, according to the following Proposition.</p>

                     <hi>PROPOSITION.</hi> A Circle being described, representing a Declining Reclining Dial Plain; how thereon to place the <hi>Meridian, Horizon, Aequinoctial, Pole, Zenith,</hi> &amp;c. with all other Requisites belonging to such a Dial. And also to Project the Meridians of the Sphere it self upon the Plain, and from thence to draw the Hour-lines upon the Dial-plain, according to their true situation.</head>
                  <p>LEt the Circle H S O B, represent a Dial-plain in the Latitude of <hi>London</hi> 51 deg. 32 min. Declining from the North towards the West 60 deg. 00 min. and Reclining from the Zenith Northward 54 deg. 00 min.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Cross the Circle with the two Diameters H O, and S B, cutting each other at Right angles in the Centre Q. And because the Plain Reclineth 54 deg. 30 min. take 54 deg. 30 min. out of your Line of Chords, and set that distance upon your Plain, from S to <hi>a,</hi> from O to <hi>b,</hi> and from B to <hi>c:</hi> Then lay a Ruler from H to <hi>a,</hi> and it will cut the Line S B in Z, so shall the point Z be the Zenith of the place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Lay a Ruler from H to <hi>b</hi> it will cut the line S B in <hi>k,</hi> so shall <hi>k</hi> be a point in the line S B, through which the Horizon shall pass: And thus having three points H <hi>k</hi> O, you may through them describe the Horizon, whose Centre will be at <hi>m,</hi> the distance in <hi>k,</hi> being equal to the Secant of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59915:65"/>the Complement of the Reclination of the plain; namely, 36 deg.â Or Geometrically thus. Draw the right-line <hi>k</hi> O, which divide into two equal parts in <hi>n,</hi> and upon the point <hi>n,</hi> raise a perpendicular <hi>n m,</hi> extending it till it cut the line S B in <hi>m,</hi> so shall <hi>m</hi> be the Centre of the Horizontal Circle H <hi>k</hi> O.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Lay a Ruler from H to <hi>c,</hi> it will cut the line S B (being extended) in the point N, so shall N be the Nadir point.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Because the Plain declines 60 deg. from the North Westward; set 60 deg. from B to <hi>d,</hi> and laying a Ruler to Z, the Zenith, (which is also the Pole of the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon) to <hi>d,</hi> it will cut the Horizon in <hi>s,</hi> through which point the Meridian must pass.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Take (always) 90 deg. of your Chord, and set that distance from <hi>d</hi> to <hi>e,</hi> and laying a Ruler from Z to <hi>e,</hi> it will cut the Horizon in W, the West point thereof, and a line drawn from W, through Q the centre of your Plain, will cut the Horizon (if you extend it, as here is done) in E, the East point thereof, and in some part of this line (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended if need require) wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Divide the line Z N into two equal parts in F, and upon F erect the perpendicular F D, cutting the line E W (extended) in D, so shall D be the Centre of the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of the place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> If with your Compasses you take the distance D R, and with that extent upon D, as a Centre, describe a Circle, you shall find that Circle exactly to pass through the respective points Z <hi>s</hi> and N, if there be no former error com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in your work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eightly,</hi> Because the height of the Pole above the Horizon, is equal to the Latitude of the place, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>London</hi> 51 deg. 32 min. set off 51 deg. 32 min. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <p>
                     <hi>Tenthly,</hi> The Meridian and Horizon being thus drawn, it is easie to describe the Equinoctial, for if you consider the position of that Circle in the Sphere it self, you know that it alwayes passes through the East and West points of the Horizon, and cutteth the Meridian at right Angles, it being in all places 90 deg. distant from either of the Poles. Wherefore, if upon W, (the Pole of the Meridian) you lay a Ruler to P, the Pole of the World, it will cut the Plain in <hi>f,</hi> and if you set 90 deg. from <hi>f</hi> to <hi>g,</hi> and lay a Ruler from W to <hi>g,</hi> it will cut the Meridian in AE, so have you three points, through which the Equinoctial must pass, namely E AE and W, and the Centre of the Equinoctial will alwayes be in the Axis of the World, extended if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. To find which, you must</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> Divide the line W E into two equal parts in G, and from the point G, upon the line E W, erect the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular G K, cutting the Axis of the World in K, so shall K, be the Centre of the Equinoctial, wherefore, if upon K as a Centre, with the distance K W, you describe a Circle, that shall be the Equinoctial, and (if you work be true) shall pass through the points E AE W: Then for the dividing of the Equinoctial.</p>

Then laying a Ruler from P, upon each of these divisions, you shall find it to cut the line C T in the points 15, 30, 45, 60, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on either side of the point D. And here note, that 15 is the Centre of the first hours distance from the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an on either side thereof, 30 the Centre of the second, and 45 of the third hours distance, from the Meridian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifteenthly,</hi> If you place one foot of your Compasses upon 15, and extend the other to <hi>P,</hi> the Pole of the World,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59915:68"/>and with that distance describe a Circle, that Circle shall be the first hour from the Meridian, and (if your work be true) shall past through M the South Pole, and also through Ì· Ì·, the two first unequal divisions of the Equinoctial Circle, and so all the rest.</p>

But here you see, that the Centres of the Meridians or Hour-circles fall out to be very remote, and that there will be required a large Tangent-line for their description, which will (for the most part) run out very far, and sometimes almost to an infinite excursion. I therefore chose rather to shew how the hour-lines might be drawn without having any regard to this Tangent-line, or without projecting of the hour-lines upon the Circular-plain, and therefore the ways before delivered are far more apt for pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice than this, though this be more satisfactory to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive Reader, who will not be satisfied only with the doing, but off the understanding as well of what he does, and it is for the satisfaction of such that I have here added this Proposition.</p>

               <p>Again, of <hi>Reclining Declining,</hi> I told you there were six Varieties also, as there were of Direct Recliners, <hi>viz.</hi> Three of South Declining Plains Reclining, and as many of North
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59915:72"/>Reclining Declining Plains; of all which I have given Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and it may be now expected that I should do the like for the Inclining Plains opposite to them, of which there are also as many Varieties, but seeing that the making of the Reclining Dial, whither Direct or Declining, doth also make the Inclining Dial, whither Direct or Declining opposite thereunto, I shall save the labour, and commend to the ingenious Reader some few Rules, by which he shall easily frame the Inclining Dial out of the Recliner. And</p>

                  <p>I will take for Example a South Plain Reclining 55 deg. which is the third Variety of South Recliners, and I would from that deduce the hour-lines proper for a North Plain Inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much, <hi>viz.</hi> 55 deg. And it is easily affected. For,</p>
                  <p>If you draw the hour-lines of the South Recliner 6 A B 6, and the Stile thereof also, quite through the Centre Q, to the opposite part of the Plain, 6 C D 6, and set the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59915:72"/>same numbers to the hours on the right-hand in the Recliner, and the contrary, as the Figure clearly demonstrates: And let the Axis in the North Incliner, point downwards to the South Pole. As the Axis in the South Recliner doth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the North Pole, and your Dial is finished. Or you may effect this work by pricking off the hour-lines through the Paper, and turning it upside down, and that will effect the same thing, only changing of the names of the hours. Or again, If you turn the South Reclining Plain 6 A B 6 about, upon the Centre Q, till the line A B come to be in the place of C D, then will the hours, stile and all, be truly named and posited; and the very South Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliner will now become the North Incliner without any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration.</p>

                  <p>There is little difference in drawing of the East or West Inclining Dials, from the Reclining Dials opposite to them, then there was of drawing of the North Incliner before, from the South Recliner. For,</p>
                  <p>In the Example of the East and West Reclining and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Dial, before going Chapter 10. The Dial as it there stands represents an East or West Reclining Plain. But if you turn the Dial about upon the Centre Q, till the letter N come to be in the place of the letter S, in that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, then will the same Dial represent both an East an West Dial Inclining 35 deg. as now it doth an East or West Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining as much.

                  <p>Of North and South Reclining Declining Plains, there were six Varieties, Examples of each have been largely given. There are as many of North and South Incliners, but seeing they may be so easily deduced out of their opposite Recli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, I shall forbear giving Examples, and the way is not much differing from the Rules before given for Direct Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining and Inclining Plains. For seeing the Reclination is alike proper to each, and the Deflexion of the Substile from the Meridian in the Declinations do so directly agree, they may both be reduced to one and the same Dial as the other were.</p>
                  <p>Thus, if any Reclining Dial be so inverted, that the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part thereof, become the neither, and after this inversion the right-side of the Recliner, become the left-side of the Incliner, and the contrary, the Inclining Dial having the same Declination, shall be framed out of the Recliner, and the contrary. Only the Denominations of the Hours must be changed. For the forenoon Hours in the Recliner, will be the afternoon Hours in the Incliner, and the afternoon Hours of the upper Dial, the forenoon Hours of the nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                  <p>Now, (because Examples do more confirm the fancy than barely Precepts) I shall by President or Example make plain all that hath hitherto been delivered, and one shall serve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed of many, and that shall be in an Upright or Erect De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Plain, (which of all Dials are the most common and useful.)

                  <p>By the Rules delivered in the III. <hi>Section</hi> of these <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,</hi> you shall find,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>The height of the Pole (or Stile) above the Plain, to be</hi> 33 deg. 38 min.</item>

                  </list>
                  <p>These <hi>Requisites</hi> being thus attained, the next thing is to find the hour distances upon the Plain, which may be done by the last foregoing <hi>Analogy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But first, you are to consider the quantity of the Plains difference of Longitude, which here, in this Example, is found to be 29 deg. 15 min. And (because every hours di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance upon the Equinoctial is 15 deg. distance from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile, so 2 hours is 30 deg. distance, and 3 hours is 45 deg. distance: This Plains difference of Longitude being above 15 deg.) which is one hours distance) and less than 30 deg. (which is two hours distance) the Substile (the Plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Westerly) must needs fall between the hours of 1 and 2. Wherefore, Substract 15 deg. (1 hours distance) from 29 deg. 15 min. and there will remain 14 deg. 15 min. the Equinoctial distance of 1 a clock from the Substile. Also from 30 deg. (which is 2 hours distance) Substract 29 deg. 15 m. and the remainer will be co deg. 15 min. for the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial distance of 2. a clock from the Substile. Having found the Equinoctial distances of the two next hour-lines on either side of the Substile (as of 1 and 2) the rest are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily found by the continual addition of 15 deg. and so is the Column of the Equinoctial distances in the following Table made. Being thus prepared, the true hour distances from the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59915:81"/>Substile upon the Plain may easily be attained by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going <hi>Analogy.</hi> I will instance in one hours distance for all, and give you the rest in a Table; As,</p>

               <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>IT will be to little purpose to be thus curious in finding of the true Positions of the Meridian Stile, Substile, and Hour distances in all Plains, as in the foregoing precepts is delivered, unless also we be as severe or strict in finding of the Stile or Position of the Plain, upon which the Dial is to be made. For, what will it signifie to make the Dial true, and place it in a wrong position. You are in the Geometrical part of this Book taught how to find the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of any Plain, and for the finding of it, to attain to the true Azimuth of the Sun is the chief ingredient, and how to perform that Geometrically is there taught two ways. But that the like exactness may be in the performance of this also, I shall in this place (before I end) exhibit the manner of finding the Sun's Azimuth at any time, and in any place, by Arithmetical calculation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Example,</hi> In the Latitude of 51 deg. 32 min. the Sun having 17 deg. 56 min. of North declination, and his Altitude 35 deg. Let it be required to find his Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Add the Complement of the Latitude, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of the Declination, and the Complement of the Suns Altitude all into one sum, and take the half thereof, from which half sum Substract the Complement of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and note the difference, as here is done.</p>

               <head>CHAP. <hi>I.</hi> A Description of the Instrument.</head>
               <p>THE Instrument may most conveniently be made of Brass upon a thin Plate, (the thinner the better.) Let it be made in the form of a right-angled Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle, one of the sides containing the right-angle being in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59915:85"/>the figure marked with A B, let be divided as a Line of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Sines, and the other side noted with A C, let be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a Line of Natural Tangents, and of such length that it may contain 75 degrees at the least of the same Radius with the Line of Sines. Let both the Sines and Tangents be numbered from A by 10, 20, 30, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the usual manner, the Sines to 90 deg. and the Tangents to 75 or upwards. â The devisions of both these lines must be graduated close to the outer edges of the Brass as Protra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors are usually divided, and the Metal not exceeding that thickness.â On the third Edge B C, is graduated a line of double Tangents of any Radius, such as the Line is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to receive 45 deg. on either side from the middle thereof, from D to E 45 deg. and from D to F as many; which Tangents are to be numbred not into degrees of a Circle, but into degrees of Time, allowing 15 deg. to 1 hour, 30 for 2 hours, and 45 for 3 hours, and the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate parts for halves and quarters, and in larger In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments into smaller parts. â This I ca'l the Scale of hours, and must be numbered as in the figure XII. standing at one end, and VI. at the other end thereof, IX. and III. in the middle, and the rest in order, as in the figure.â And it were not amiss, if the Tangent-line A C were marked at the degrees of Time, as well as into degrees of the Circle, which will be useful in the description of East, West, and Equinoctial Dials, both Direct and Declining.</p>
               <p>In some convenient place of the Plate you may have one, two, or three lines of Chords, to several Radius's, which will perform the work of the first part of this Book, and will also be serviceable in this.</p>
               <p>Also it would be necessary that the other side of the Plate were Graduated for the lines of Sines and Tangents, in all respects, as the fore-side: But for the line of hours it were

                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>s to have two or three of them of several lengths' as in practice you may find occasion for, though one will do all. And this may easily and commodiously be done if the middle of the Plate be cut out, and then on all the inner edges of the Plate you may have several Lines of Hours, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them Chords also. A Quadrant also maybe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected upon this Instrument, and then it will be serviceable to take a declination of a Plain; for by it you may find the Azimuth. The Instrument thus fitted will be very portable, and very exact and easie in practice. For these last mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parts I leave them to Discretion of the Artificer, or the Will of the Owner, the first three lines being sufficient to perform all the following works. This Instrument thus made, I call (in respect of the figure of it) an <hi>Horological Trigon.</hi> The uses whereof are exhibited in the following Chapters.</p>

                  <p>THere is no difference in the construction of these seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sorts of Dials, the height of the Pole or Stile above the Plain being first attained, which how to effect, is at large taught Geometrically in the first Part Chap 3. and in the second Part Sect. 1. and therefore in this place will be needless to recite. Wherefore let us take one Example for all, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To draw the hour-lines on a</hi> Vertical <hi>or</hi> Horizontal <hi>Plain, in the Latitude of</hi> 51 <hi>deg.</hi> 32 <hi>min.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Upon your Plain (or upon a Sheet of Paper) draw a right-line A B for the Meridian (or hour-line of 12,) and assigning any point therein (as A) for the Centre of your Dial, and through it draw the line C A D at right-angles, for the hour-line of 6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Lay the Centre of your Trigon, to the Centre of your Dial, so that the Tangent-line thereof may lye upon the line of 12, and the line of Sines upon the line of six.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> With a Needle (or Protracting Pin) make a Marke upon the Meridian-line, against (the Radius or) 45 deg. as the point E. And upon the line of 6 make another marke, against the Sine of your Stiles height (in this Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple against 51 deg. 32 min.) as at F, and draw the line E F. Do the like on the other side of the Meridian-line, by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     </figure> A G equal to A F, and draw the line E G.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Divide the lines E F and E G (each of them) into two equal parts, in the points 9 and 3, and from the Centre of your Dial through these points 9 and 3, draw two right-lines, which shall be the hour-lines of 9 and 3 of the Clock.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> For the drawing of the rest of the hours, Lay the line of hours upon your Trigon to your Plain, in such manner, that the Point or end thereof noted with 6, and the other end or point thereof noted with 12, may justly touch the hour-lines of 12 and 6 upon your Dial plain, and move the line of hours between the two hour-lines of 12
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59915:87"/>and 6 backwards or forwards (as occasion shall require) till the middle of the line of hours, noted with the hours 9 and 3, rest just upon the hour-line of 9 or 3 upon your Plain. â Your line of hours lying in this Position, with your Protracting Pin (or Needle) make marks upon your Plain, against every hour, half, and Quarter, as the Points ***, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> â And from the Centre of your Dial, (through these respective Points) draw right-lines and they shall be the true hour-lines proper to your Plain.</p>
                  <p>Do the like on the other side of the Meridian for the afternoon-hours, and your hour-lines are all drawn, except those before 6 in the morning, and after 6 at night, which must be drawn through the Centre, according to the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction given in Part 1. Chap. 3. Folio 37.</p>
                  <p>It may seem (at first) something difficult to enter the line of hours upon your <hi>Trigon,</hi> between the hour-lines of 12 and 6, and so as the point 9 or 3 may rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hour-line of 9 or 3 also, but know, this is no difficulty at all, but wonderful easie, and so expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, that the <hi>Trigon</hi> is prepared to prick down all the hours, halves, and quarters, as soon as you could with your Compasses take one of them out of a Scale, and will give you the hour-points upon the Plain more exact than you can set them well off with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes.â And farther Note, that your <hi>Trigon</hi> lying in this Position, the line of hours on your <hi>Trigon,</hi> will always lye Parallel to the lines E F, and E G, if there be no former error.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> For the height of the Stile above the Plain (it is in this example equal to the Latitude of the place 51 deg. 32 min.) this you may set off by a line of Chords (as hath been often shewed before) but by the <hi>Trigon</hi> thus.â Lay the Centre of your <hi>Trigon</hi> upon the point E, the line of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59915:87"/>Sines lying upon the Meridian (or 12 a clock) line, then against the Tangent of 51 deg. 32 min. make a marke as H, and draw the line A H for the Stile, so is your Dial finished.</p>
                  <p>And according to this precept may the hour lines upon all <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South Direct Plains</hi> be drawn, without any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble, and so for such Plains let this one precept suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>

                     <hi>First,</hi> Draw (by the directions in Part I. Chap. 6. Folio 44. a right-line A B, for the Equinoctial, and in any point

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Assign any point in the hour-line of 6, (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional to the bigness of your Plain) as F for the height of your perpendicular Stile, or Gnomen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Lay the Trigon to your Plain, so that the Line of Sines may lye just upon the hour-line of 6, and the end thereof at 90 deg. upon the point F.â The <hi>Trigon</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Position, with your Needle or protracting Pin, make marks upon your Plain, by the side of the Tangent-line upon your <hi>Trigon,</hi> at every hour, half, and quarter at the marks ****, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (for the Tangent-line upon the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> is divided into hours and parts of time, as well as into degrees and minutes.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Lay a Ruler to F, and every one of these hours, halfs, and quarters, and where the Ruler crosseth the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial-line of the Plain A B, as at the points â â â, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> through those points draw right-lines parallel to the hour-line of 6, and they shall be the true hours proper for your Plain.</p>
                  <p>For the hours before 6 in the morning on the <hi>East Dial,</hi> and after 6 at night on the <hi>West Dial,</hi> the same distances set backwards upon the Equinoctial-line, will give you those Points, as is directed in Part I. Chap. 6. Fol. 46.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note,</hi> If you make your Dial answerable to the bigness of your <hi>Trigon,</hi> much of the labour in making of this Dial will be saved: For, when you have drawn A B the Equinoctial, and crossed it at right-angles, with the line C D E for the hour-line of 6.â Lay the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the <hi>Trigon</hi> upon the point D, and the Tangent-line of the <hi>Trigon</hi> upon the Equinoctial-line of the Plain, and so making marks at every hour, half, and quarrer, lines drawn through those points parallel to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59915:88"/>the hour-line of 6, shall be the true hours proper for the Plain. â And here <hi>Note</hi> also, that the line A B first drawn, must make an angle with the Horizontal-plain, equal to the Complement of the Latitude of the place, for which the Dial is made.</p>
                  <p>What is said of the East Plain, the same is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the West, as in Part I. Chap. 6. Fol. 46. and the same of the Equinoctial Plain also, only the 6 a clock hour-line in these Plains, is the 12 a clock hour-line in those, as in Part I. Chap. 12. is sufficiently explained.</p>

            <p>FOrasmuch as the Latitude of the place, and the Suns place, or declination (rather) are such necessary ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents in the making of Dials, that you can hardly make a Dial in any part of the World, but you must first know in what Latitude that place is. And also when the Latitude of the Place is known, the Situation of the Plain must also be obtained; which can hardly be done without knowing the Suns Azimuth, (for I wholly reject that way of the Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Needle) and that Azimuth will require the Suns De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to the finding of it. I thought good at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of this Book to add a Table of the Suns Declination for every day in the year, which may be ready at hand, when at any time you are to take the Declination of a Plain: And also a Table of the Latitudes of the Principal Cities and Towns in <hi>Great Brittain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> so that if you are to make a Dial in any of those parts, you may have recourse to this Table, and make your Dial to the Latitude of that place, which you find to be nearest to the place where you are to make your Dial.</p>
